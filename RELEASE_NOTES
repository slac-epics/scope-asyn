This is a new implementation of a support module for digital oscilloscopes.
It is a consolidation of two separate implementation, one for Tektronix
tds3000 series, the other for Rigol DS4000 and DS6000 series scopes, into
a single support module.

Modifications made to drvScope.cpp needed to read traces synchronously.  This
was done by: 1. stopping acquisition, 2. reading all enabled traces, and
3. starting acquisition.
This modification is needed for the Kicker Magnet scope.
