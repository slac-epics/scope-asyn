==============================================================================

R1.5.0  M. Dunning (mdunning) 08-Jun-2023
    Significant rewrite of Tektronix support:
        - Create Tek class, which Tektronix drivers inherit from.  This makes adding new models much easier; 
                for most scopes, drivers likely only need to implement the _parseWfPreamble and _initializeParams methods.
    Add driver for MDO34 series scopes.
    Bug fixes.
    More code cleanup and optimization.

R1.4.1  M. Dunning (mdunning) 19-Jan-2023
    Make measurement type and state user adjustable
    Set traces to be on by default, and use autosave
    More code cleanup

R1.4.0  M. Dunning (mdunning) 31-Mar-2022
    Code cleanup:
        Fix formatting issues
        Use "new" asynPortDriver constructor, which does not need number of parameters (requires asyn >= 4-32)
    Add support for scope measurements
    Fix bug in setting and initializing waveform data type
    Add autosaved channel description PVs
    Modify tds3x trigger commands to also support DPO2x scopes    
    Fix acquire state readback when run/stop changed
